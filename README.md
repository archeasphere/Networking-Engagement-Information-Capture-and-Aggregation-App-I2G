# Networking-Engagement-Information-Capture-and-Aggregation-App-I2G
A File storage app to be used as an organization tool 
The requirement of this phase of the project is a web and mobile application that:
  - captures objects (first text notes, then other file types)
  - assigns a unique identifier and a URL to every new object
  - stores the object with the timestamp and other metadata (when, where, who, what)
  - enables the user to search for objects (by when, where, who, what)
  - enables the user to select objects and connect them into new objects
